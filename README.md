A repository for downscaling ESA CCI Soil moisture products using Sentinel or Landsat Products

Numerous output data are required for the use of the scripts. 

- annual mean/standard deviation NDWI /NDVI (Sentinel 2)
- DEM (aspect, slope, convergence)
- TWI 
- Sentinel 1/Landsat data 
- SWI data
- ESA Landcover 
- extent study area as shp

Except for the DEM derivatives, this repository provides all the tools to calculate soil moisture at higher resolution. 
The description of the individual scripts can be found in README_Scripts.
